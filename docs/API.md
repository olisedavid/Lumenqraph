# API reference

Base URL defaults to `http://localhost:8080`.

Auth: data routes accept an API key via `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or
`x-api-key: <key>`. When `REQUIRE_API_KEY=false` (default), unauthenticated
callers are allowed up to `ANON_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN`. `/health` and `/metrics`
are always public. Rate-limit breaches return `429`; bad/revoked keys `401`.

## Error responses

Every error response includes a stable `code` field alongside the human-readable
`error` message:

```json
{ "code": "not_found", "error": "no event found with id '...'" }
```

Use the `code` field — not the `error` string — to branch in SDKs and integrations.
Error messages are intended for humans and may change between versions; codes are
stable and will not be renamed or removed.

| Code                | HTTP status | When                                                                  |

## Public

### `GET /health`
Human-readable status: indexing freshness and chain-tip lag.
```json
{ "status": "ok", "network": "mainnet",
  "network_passphrase": "Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015",
  "last_processed_ledger": 3550886, "chain_tip_ledger": 3550886,
  "lag_ledgers": 0, "seconds_since_cursor_update": 1,
  "events_ingested_total": 4895, "errors_total": 0 }
```
`network` is which Stellar network this deployment indexes (`mainnet` /
`testnet` / `futurenet` / `custom`), asked of the RPC itself and cached — so
clients (like the explorer) can adapt instead of asking the user. `null` while
the RPC is unreachable.

When the operator has mounted sibling instances (`INSTANCE_MOUNTS`, e.g. the
hosted demo serving a testnet deployment under the same origin), `/health` also
advertises them as `"mounts": { "testnet": "/testnet" }` — every endpoint
documented here works under that prefix, served by the sibling.

### `GET /livez`
Kubernetes-style liveness probe: returns `200 OK` if the process is running,
nothing else. Requires no database access and no logic beyond "is the server
listening?" Used by orchestrators to detect dead or stuck processes and restart
them.

### `GET /readyz`
Kubernetes-style readiness probe: returns `200 OK` only when the indexer is
caught up and healthy; otherwise `503 Service Unavailable`. Checks:
- Database is reachable
- Cursor has been created (at least one pass through the event stream)
- Indexing lag is below the threshold (default: 100 ledgers)
- Cursor was updated recently (default: within 120 seconds)

Used by orchestrators to route traffic only to ready instances and avoid
cascading restarts during slow startup. Configurable via environment:
- `READYZ_LAG_THRESHOLD` (ledgers, default 100)
- `READYZ_MAX_AGE_SECS` (seconds, default 120)

### `GET /metrics`
Prometheus text: `lumenqraph_indexer_lag_ledgers`, `lumenqraph_events_total`,
`lumenqraph_indexer_ingested_total`, `lumenqraph_indexer_errors_total`,
`lumenqraph_api_requests_total`, …

## Data (authenticated / rate-limited)

### `GET /contracts`
Contracts seen, with `event_count`, `first_seen_ledger`, `last_seen_ledger`.

### `GET /contracts/:id/events`
Query: `limit` (1–1000, default 50), `offset`, `event_name` (e.g. `transfer`),
`after` (cursor for pagination).

**Pagination:** Use cursor pagination (`after` parameter) for production use.
Offset pagination is **deprecated** due to linear performance degradation and is
capped at 10,000 rows. For deeper pages, use the `next_cursor` from the previous
response as the `after` parameter.

**Filtering:** The `param` filter matches against the `enriched` JSON field using
containment queries (e.g., `?param={"from":"GXXX"}`). The enriched column has a
GIN index for efficient filtering.

Each row has raw base64 (`topics`, `value`) **and** decoded JSON
(`decoded_topics`, `decoded_value`), plus `event_name`, `tx_hash`, `ledger`, …

Response:
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "has_more": true,
  "next_cursor": "3550885:0015250934946869248-0000000000"
}
```

### `GET /events/:event_id`
Fetch a **single** event by its unique `event_id`. Returns the full event row
(raw XDR, decoded JSON, and enriched record); `404` if no event with that id is
indexed. Useful for re-fetching an event whose `event_id` was received in a
webhook delivery or other response.
```json
{
  "event_id": "0015250934946869248-0000000000",
  "contract_id": "CDLZFC3S...",
  "ledger": 3550885,
  "event_name": "transfer",
  "decoded_topics": ["transfer", "G...", "G...", "native"],
  "decoded_value": "100000000000",
  "enriched": { "event": "transfer", "params": { "from": { "type": "Address", "value": "G..." }, "to": { "type": "Address", "value": "G..." }, "amount": { "type": "i128", "value": "100000000000" } } },
  "tx_hash": "3664562a...",
  "in_successful_call": true
}
```

### `GET /transactions/:tx_hash/events`
All indexed events emitted by a transaction, in the order they were emitted
on-chain (`ledger ASC, event_id ASC`). Query: `limit` (1–1000, default 100).
Returns `{ "tx_hash": "...", "count": N, "data": [...] }`. Useful for debugging
"what did my transaction do?".
```json
{
  "tx_hash": "3664562a...",
  "count": 2,
  "data": [
    { "event_id": "...", "event_name": "transfer", "ledger": 3550885, "..." },
    { "event_id": "...", "event_name": "mint",     "ledger": 3550885, "..." }
  ]
}
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/transfers`
Materialized SEP-41 transfers. Query: `limit`, `offset`, `from`, `to`.
```json
[{ "from_addr": "G...", "to_addr": "G...", "amount": "100000000000",
   "ledger": 3550885, "event_id": "..." }]
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/swaps`
Materialized AMM swap events, newest first. Query: `limit` (1–1000, default 50),
`offset`, `after` (cursor), `sender`, `sell_token`, `buy_token`.
```json
{
  "data": [
    { "event_id": "...", "contract_id": "CB...", "sender": "G...",
      "sell_token": "C...", "buy_token": "C...",
      "sell_amount": "1000000000", "buy_amount": "987654321",
      "ledger": 3550885, "ledger_closed_at": "2026-07-15T..." }
  ],
  "has_more": false,
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/nfts`
Materialized NFT events (mint/transfer/burn), newest first. Query: `limit`
(1–1000, default 50), `offset`, `after` (cursor), `kind` (`mint`|`transfer`|`burn`),
`from`, `to`, `token_id`.
```json
{
  "data": [
    { "event_id": "...", "contract_id": "CB...", "event_kind": "transfer",
      "from_addr": "G...", "to_addr": "G...", "token_id": "42",
      "ledger": 3550885, "ledger_closed_at": "2026-07-15T..." }
  ],
  "has_more": false,
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/liquidity`
Materialized liquidity events (add/remove), newest first. Query: `limit`
(1–1000, default 50), `offset`, `after` (cursor), `kind` (`add`|`remove`),
`provider`.
```json
{
  "data": [
    { "event_id": "...", "contract_id": "CB...", "event_kind": "add",
      "provider": "G...", "amount_a": "500000000", "amount_b": "500000000",
      "shares": "999999", "ledger": 3550885, "ledger_closed_at": "2026-07-15T..." }
  ],
  "has_more": false,
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/interface`
The decoded on-chain interface: `functions`, `events`, `structs`, `unions`,
`enums`. Query: `version` (a historical version; default is the current one).
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "has_events": true,
  "interface": { "functions": [...], "events": [...], "structs": [], "unions": [], "enums": [] },
  "fetched_at": "2026-07-15T..." }
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/interface/history`
Every interface version observed, newest first. Query: `limit` (1–200, default 50).
Requires the indexer's `UPGRADE_WATCH`.
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "count": 2, "versions": [
  { "version": 2, "wasm_hash": "...", "previous_wasm_hash": "...",
    "breaking": true, "observed_at": "2026-07-15T...Z",
    "diff": { "breaking": true, "summary": ["removed function withdraw() -> void"],
              "functions": { "added": [], "removed": ["withdraw() -> void"], "changed": [] },
              "events": { "added": [], "removed": [], "changed": [] },
              "types":  { "added": [], "removed": [], "changed": [] } } },
  { "version": 1, "previous_wasm_hash": null, "breaking": false, "diff": null }
] }
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/interface/diff`
Diff any two versions. Query: `from`, `to` (default: the latest upgrade, i.e.
`to` = newest, `from` = the one before). `400` if the contract has only a
baseline version, or if `from` == `to`; `404` for an unknown version.
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "from": 1, "to": 2,
  "diff": { "breaking": true,
    "summary": ["removed function withdraw(amount: i128) -> void"],
    "functions": { "added": [], "removed": ["withdraw(amount: i128) -> void"], "changed": [] },
    "events": { "added": [], "removed": [], "changed": [] },
    "types": { "added": [], "removed": [], "changed": [] } } }
```

`breaking` is true when anything was removed or changed — an integration built
against the old interface may no longer work. Additions alone are not breaking.

### `GET /contracts/:id/state`
Versioned snapshots of the contract's **instance storage** (admin, config,
counters…), newest first. Query: `limit` (1–200, default 1 = current state).
Requires the indexer's `STATE_INDEXING`; `404` if there are no snapshots.
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "count": 1, "versions": [
  { "ledger": 3550880, "storage": [
      { "key": "METADATA", "val": { "name": "Token", "symbol": "TKN" } },
      { "key": ["TotalSupply"], "val": "1000" }
    ], "captured_at": "2026-07-15T..." }] }
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/data`
The current value of every **per-key** entry snapshotted for this contract —
e.g. each tracked holder's `Balance(Address)`. One row per key (its latest
snapshot). Query: `label` (e.g. `balance`), `limit` (1–1000, default 100).
Requires the indexer's `KEY_INDEXING`.
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "count": 2, "keys": [
  { "key_hash": "9f2c…", "key": ["Balance", "G..."], "durability": "persistent",
    "ledger": 3550881, "value": "500", "label": "balance",
    "captured_at": "2026-07-15T..." }] }
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/data/:key_hash`
The version history of a single per-key entry (one holder's balance over time),
newest first. Query: `limit` (1–500, default 1).
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "key_hash": "9f2c…",
  "key": ["Balance", "G..."], "durability": "persistent", "label": "balance",
  "count": 3, "versions": [
    { "ledger": 3550881, "value": "500", "captured_at": "2026-07-15T..." },
    { "ledger": 3550870, "value": "450", "captured_at": "2026-07-15T..." },
    { "ledger": 3550850, "value": "400", "captured_at": "2026-07-15T..." }
  ] }
```

## Read layer (authenticated)

Invoke contracts through RPC simulation. Arguments are type-checked against the
contract's on-chain spec *before* the network call, so mistakes come back as a
`400` with a precise message rather than an opaque simulation failure. Nothing
is ever signed or submitted.

### `GET /contracts/:id/functions`
The contract's callable functions with typed inputs/outputs.
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "functions": [
  { "name": "balance", "inputs": [{ "name": "id", "type": "Address" }],
    "outputs": ["i128"], "is_view": true }] }
```
`is_view` is a **best-effort** heuristic, not a guarantee: Soroban's
`contractspecv0` carries no `view`/`mutable` keyword (unlike Solidity's ABI),
so it is inferred from the function's output type (`void` usually means a
state change) and its name (a known mutating prefix like `set_`, `transfer`,
`mint`, `withdraw`, `upgrade`, …). A function marked `is_view: true` is
probably safe via `/call`; when in doubt, or when `is_view` is `false`, prefer
`/simulate`.

### `POST /contracts/:id/call`
Invoke a **view** function read-only and return a typed result.
Body: `{ "function": "balance", "args": { "id": "G..." }, "source_account": null }`
— `args` takes an object keyed by parameter name, or a positional array.
`source_account` accepts both a plain Ed25519 public key (`G…` strkey) and a
muxed account (`M…` strkey) for sub-account routing.
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "function": "balance",
  "result": "500", "simulated_at_ledger": 3550886 }
```

### `POST /contracts/:id/simulate`
Dry-run **any** call, including state-changing ones, and get the typed result,
the events it would emit (decoded + enriched), and its estimated resource fee.
Same body as `/call`.
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "function": "transfer", "result": null,
  "events": [
    { "contract_id": "CB...", "type": "contract", "event": "transfer",
      "topics": ["transfer", "G...", "G..."], "data": "500",
      "enriched": { "event": "transfer", "params": { "amount": { "type": "i128", "value": "500" } } } }],
  "min_resource_fee": "34561", "simulated_at_ledger": 3550886 }
```
`fn_call`/`fn_return` diagnostic noise is dropped; `enriched` is non-null only
for events emitted by the contract being simulated, since that's the only spec
in hand.

Errors are client-facing: a wrong-typed argument gives
`400 {"error": "argument \"id\": invalid address strkey"}`, an unknown function
`400 {"error": "contract has no function named \"nope\""}`, and a contract whose
interface isn't indexed (or a Stellar Asset Contract, which has no spec) gives
`404`. A contract trap is the caller's mistake, not a server fault, so it comes
back as `400 {"error": "simulation failed: ..."}`.

## GraphQL

### `POST /graphql`
Executes queries; `GET /graphql` serves the GraphiQL IDE in a browser. Behind
the same auth and rate limiting as the REST data routes.

REST stays the primary, zero-dependency interface; GraphQL is for clients that
want to select fields and page with cursors. High-volume lists (`events`,
`transfers`) are Relay-style cursor connections; naturally bounded ones
(`contracts`, `contractState`, `contractData`) are plain lists.

```graphql
query {
  events(contractId: "CB...", first: 20) {
    edges { cursor node { ledger eventName enriched } }
    pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
  }
}
```

## Contract interface & upgrades

A Soroban contract can be upgraded in place, so its interface is a time series.
Version 1 is the first interface the indexer ever saw (a baseline: `diff` is
`null` and it fires no webhook); each later version is an upgrade. Requires the
indexer's `UPGRADE_WATCH` (on by default when `CONTRACT_IDS` is set).

### `GET /contracts/:id/interface`
The decoded on-chain interface: `functions`, `events`, `structs`, `unions`,
`enums`. Query: `version` (a historical version; default is the current one).

### `GET /contracts/:id/interface/history`
Every version observed, newest first. Query: `limit` (1–200, default 50).
```json
{ "contract_id": "CB...", "count": 2, "versions": [
  { "version": 2, "wasm_hash": "...", "previous_wasm_hash": "...",
    "breaking": true, "observed_at": "2026-07-15T...Z",
    "diff": { "breaking": true, "summary": ["removed function withdraw() -> void"],
              "functions": { "added": [], "removed": ["withdraw() -> void"], "changed": [] },
              "events": { "added": [], "removed": [], "changed": [] },
              "types":  { "added": [], "removed": [], "changed": [] } } },
  { "version": 1, "previous_wasm_hash": null, "breaking": false, "diff": null }
] }
```

### `GET /contracts/:id/interface/diff`
Diff any two versions. Query: `from`, `to` (default: the latest upgrade, i.e.
`to` = newest, `from` = the one before). `400` if the contract has only a
baseline version, or if `from` == `to`; `404` for an unknown version.

`breaking` is true when anything was removed or changed — an integration built
against the old interface may no longer work. Additions alone are not breaking.

## Generated typed clients

### `GET /contracts/:id/sdk`
A ready-to-use, typed TypeScript client for the contract, generated on demand
from its on-chain interface — the codegen equivalent of everything above. Save
it and call the contract with full type safety and zero dependencies:

```bash
curl -o contract.ts "$BASE/contracts/CB.../sdk?lang=ts"
```
```ts
import { ContractClient } from "./contract";
const c = new ContractClient({ baseUrl: "https://lumenqraph.onrender.com" });
const pool = await c.get_pool_info(); // typed from the chain's own schema
```

Query parameters:
- `lang` (`ts`, the default and only target so far; anything else is a `400`)
- `version` (generate from a historical interface version — the client your
  integration was built against *before* an upgrade; default: current)

The generator maps contract types to TypeScript:
- Structs → interfaces
- Unit enums → case-name literal types
- Unions → `"Case" | { Case: [...] }` shapes

Because `/call` results are named with the same spec, what a call returns is
exactly what the next call accepts. Generation is deterministic: same interface
version, same output.

**Limitations:**
- Stellar Asset Contracts have no WASM spec and cannot be code-generated.
  Attempt to generate from them returns `404`.
- Only TypeScript targets are currently supported (`lang=ts`).
- Some advanced Soroban types may not have complete TypeScript mappings.

**Success response:** The generated TypeScript client source code (content-type:
`text/plain`). The client is self-contained and zero-dependency.

Requires the contract's interface to be indexed (the first time the indexer saw
an event from that contract, or when `STATE_INDEXING` is enabled). Stellar Asset
Contracts (no WASM spec) cannot be generated from.

## Webhooks (authenticated)

### `POST /webhooks`
Body: `{ "url": "https://...", "kind": "event", "contract_id": null, "event_name": "transfer" }`
(all but `url` optional). Returns the subscription including a one-time `secret`
used to verify the `X-Lumenqraph-Signature: sha256=<hmac>` header on deliveries.

`kind` is `event` (default: a contract emitted an event; the payload is the event
row) or `upgrade` (a contract's interface changed). `event_name` doesn't apply to
`upgrade` subscriptions — scope them with `contract_id`, or omit it for all
contracts. An `upgrade` delivery is signed identically, and carries:
```json
{ "type": "contract.upgraded", "contract_id": "CB...", "version": 2,
  "wasm_hash": "...", "previous_wasm_hash": "...", "breaking": true,
  "diff": { "...": "as in /interface/diff" }, "observed_at": "2026-07-15T...Z" }
```

### `GET /webhooks`
Lists subscriptions (secrets omitted).

### `PATCH /webhooks/:id`
Pause/resume or update a subscription without losing its secret.
Body: `{ "active": false, "contract_id": null, "event_name": "transfer" }`
(all fields optional; omitted fields keep their current value).

Returns the updated subscription (secrets omitted). Allows:
- Toggling the `active` status (true = deliver, false = paused)
- Updating `contract_id` and `event_name` filters (same validation as creation)

### `GET /webhooks/:id/deliveries`
Delivery history and status for a subscription, most recent first.

Query parameters:
- `limit` — rows to return (1–500, default 50)
- `offset` — rows to skip for pagination (default 0)

Response includes `total_count` for computing total pages and `has_more` for
detecting whether another page exists.

```json
{
  "deliveries": [
    {
      "id": 1234,
      "status": "delivered",
      "attempts": 1,
      "last_error": null,
      "delivered_at": "2026-07-15T12:34:56Z",
      "created_at": "2026-07-15T12:34:55Z"
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 312,
  "limit": 50,
  "offset": 0,
  "has_more": true,
  "summary": {
    "delivered": 300,
    "failed": 12,
    "pending": 0
  }
}
```

### `DELETE /webhooks/:id`
Removes a subscription (and cascades its deliveries).

### `POST /webhooks/:id/rotate-secret`
Rotates the HMAC signing secret for a subscription. Returns the new secret
**once only** — store it immediately. The previous secret remains valid for a
configurable grace period (default 5 minutes, set via `WEBHOOK_SECRET_GRACE_SECS`)
so consumers can roll out the new secret without a verification gap.

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "secret": "<new-hex-secret>",
  "previous_secret_valid_until": "2025-01-24T12:05:00Z",
  "message": "Store this secret immediately — it will not be shown again."
}
```

Delivery history and the subscription watermark are fully preserved — no
deliveries are replayed and no events are missed.

### Verifying a delivery
`HMAC-SHA256(secret, raw_request_body)` hex must equal the value after
`sha256=` in `X-Lumenqraph-Signature`.
